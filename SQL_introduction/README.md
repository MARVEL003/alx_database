Let's dive into SQL:

-- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It's essential for working with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and many others. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with data stored in tables, making it a powerful tool for data management and retrieval.
